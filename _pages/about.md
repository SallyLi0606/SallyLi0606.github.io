<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student at the School of Statistics, Renmin University of China (‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÁªüËÆ°Â≠¶Èô¢), advised by [Xiaoling lv (ÂêïÊôìÁé≤)](http://cfas.ruc.edu.cn/kydw/zzyjy/lxl/index.htm). I mainly engaged in the research of the intersection of data mining and statistics. My research interest includes `Data Mining`, `Applied Statistics`, and `Statistical Analysis of Consumer Behavior`. I have published four papers at the JCR-Q1/Q2 journals.

I graduated from the School of Science at Hubei University of Technology with a major in Applied Statistics, advised by [Youxi Luo (ÁΩóÂπºÂñú)](http://cfas.ruc.edu.cn/kydw/zzyjy/lxl/index.htm). Between December 2022 and May 2024, I interned at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on applied statics and AI-driven big data on bioinformatics.

During my master studies, I ranked second in my major with an average score of 89.86. I won the first-class academic scholarship and the title of Outstanding Graduate Student at the university level for two consecutive years. I was also awarded the National Scholarship (Á†îÁ©∂ÁîüÂõΩÂÆ∂Â•ñÂ≠¶Èáë). Actively engaging in academic competitions, I have won awards in all six national-level academic competitions I participated in.
